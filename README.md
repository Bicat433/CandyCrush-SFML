Candy Crush Game in C++ with SFML

This Candy Crush project is a simple implementation of the popular game using C++ and the SFML library. The program defines a grid of candy blocks represented by a struct named 'building.' The game logic includes swapping candies to create matches, updating the score, and bringing in new blocks.

The main features of the project include:

SFML Graphics: Utilizes the SFML library for handling graphics, mouse input, and events.
Grid Management: Manages a grid of candy blocks with random initializations, allowing for the dynamic creation of candy combinations.
User Input: Responds to mouse clicks to enable candy swapping for creating matches.
Scoring System: Implements a scoring system based on the number of matches created.
Dynamic Movement: Animates the movement of candies when matches are found or when new candies are introduced.
Timer Functionality: Includes a timer to track the elapsed time during gameplay.
The project utilizes various elements such as textures, sprites, and a menu system. It incorporates a simple scoring mechanism and provides a visual representation of the candy grid. The code is organized into functions like assigningposition() for initial setup and swapping() for handling candy swaps.
